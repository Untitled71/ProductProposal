# Modern Myspace 
In my ignorance, and eccentric ideals, the future I believe in for the internet is one that I have begun to call the "indie"-net. 
Instead of social media profiles, imagine websites. Every single component customizable to the pixel in our browser. 
In essence, it would function a lot like Myspace, but with the benefit of modern security practices, as well as new technology like Typescript.

### Project Description 
Every user will get to create their own webpage. 
Users can user message boards to interact with communities. 
Users can create a post and share it to a specific community, posts retain comment across communities.  
a relational database for user, forum boards, pages, posts, and passwords. 

#### Primary users: 
- People who are willing to code, and have a strong desire to express themselves. 
  - Young Adults tired of the stereotypical Social Media platform
  - artists who want my control and thus expression on their platform
  - php guys who want to help this generation of amatuer programmers 

##### Features: 
- every user has a set of pages that they can control and customize.
- text editor for CSS and HTML
- mini IDE to display the render of their code, as the user creates the page
- CSM, content management: video, audio, and image display
- AST, an option to read md files for the user to create a blog page
